# credit-card-fraud-detection
Practical example of anomaly detection, handled using density-based anomaly detection technique

The dataset taken contains transactions made by credit cards, and we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The data is preprocessed, explored, followed by applying the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) concept and Isolation Forest algortithm  from the scikit-learn package. These algorithms when applied on the dataset will predict which transactions are fraudulent and which are not.
